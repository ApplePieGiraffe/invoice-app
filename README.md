# Invoice App - Frontend Mentor

## Intro

Hello, there! 👋

Thank you for checking out my solution to the [invoice app challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/invoice-app-i7KaLTQjl) from Frontend Mentor. 😀

Feel free to look around and explore! 😉

## Overview

For this challenge, I used...

- React and Next.js (to build out the site)
- styled-components (to style it, of course) 
- Formik and Yup (to handle the forms in the site)
- Framer Motion (for the page transitions and animations)

...and one or two other libraries to simplify things like working with dates and local storage. 😁

It was my first time using all of these libraries/packages (besides React), and so I'm not sure how I did in terms of good practices. However, I did put a bunch of effort into completing this challenge and I learned a lot along the way, so that's a win for me! 😅

## Quirks

- If the theme choice saved in local storage is dark mode, there's a quick flash of light mode that appears before the page transitions to dark mode when the page first loads. I'm pretty sure this is because of the static site generation provided by Next.js and I haven't managed to do something about it yet.
